# Fixing Migration Errors
# While creating your databases, if you make a mistake or want to edit your migrations, you can use rake db:drop to drop any tables that have been created.
#
# If you're having issues while trying to re-migrate, you can also delete schema.rb and any files with the extension .sqlite inside the db folder. Running rake db:migrate will recreate these files.

# Add seed data here. Seed your database with `rake db:seed`
