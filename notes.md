Everythings working, but talking through this extensively feels like it's going to be very necessary.
One not required bug fix (maybe to ask Howard in class tomorrow): I'm getting repeats in my list for artist/genre when I make new songs for an existing artist with the same genre. How do I add a .uniq to an erb tag logic?
