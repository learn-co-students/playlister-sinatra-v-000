#Any given song's show page should have links to that song's artist and the each genre associated with the song.
#Pay attention to the order of /songs/new and /songs/:slug. The route /songs/new could interpret new as a slug if that controller action isn't defined first.

<% @songs.each do |song| %>
<li>
  <a href="/songs/<%= song.slug %>"><%= song.name %></a>
</li>
